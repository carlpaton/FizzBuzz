# What is FizzBuzz?

A popular interview question is the "FizzBuzz test", its based on a children's game where you count from 1 to 100 and for multiples of 3 say 'Fizz', multiples of 5 say "Buzz", if both say 'FizzBuzz' else say the number.

For example, a typical round of fizz buzz would start as follows:

1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, ...

# Translated into to code domain

"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print 'Fizz' instead of the number and for the multiples of five print 'Buzz'. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print 'FizzBuzz'."
